M. Tech. Thesis Project on **Detection and Identification of Hybrid Distribution System Using Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Networks** is documented here.

### Abstract
--------------
In this thesis, Islanding and Power Quality(PQ) Issues in Hybrid Distributed Generation (DG) System consists of Photovoltaic(PV) system and Wind Power Plant connected to grid through a Point of Common Coupling(PCC), are detected and classified, using Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Networks. Wavelet Transform indices are extracted from the Negative Sequence component of the voltage signal at PCC to detect the disturbances. A feature vector is modeled with WT indices and loading of DG system to train Artificial Neural Network. . The proposed method is compared with a conventional method. The results demonstrate the advantages of Wavelet over conventional method in detection and classification of disturbances in the system and robustness in application of Machine Learning (ML) Classifier. The trained ANN is deployed as a Web Service using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio. It enhances the implementation feasibility of proposed method.

### Work Flow
-------------

1. Simulate the `simulation_diagram.mdl` using `script_get_training_data.m` for following situations and collect the training data for ANN
    - Grid Connected (Normal)
    - Islanding
    - L-L Fault 
    - L-G Fault
    - Nonlinear Load Switch
2. From negative sequence voltage at PCC during these events, extract the following features
    - Standard Deviation of detail coefficients of Wavelet Transform of negative sequence voltage signal at level 3 (`SD3`)
    - Standard Deviation of detail coefficients of Wavelet Transform of negative sequence voltage signal at level 4 (`SD4`)
    - Energy content of detail coefficients of Wavelet Transform of negative sequence voltage signal at level 3 (`E3`)
    - Energy content of detail coefficients of Wavelet Transform of negative sequence voltage signal at level 4 (`E4`)
3. ANN is trained at `Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio` by uploading the training data to cloud as a `.csv` file
    - Train the ANN locally using `main_program_ann.m` from `ann_code` folder for testing purpose
4. Sample training data would be as follows
